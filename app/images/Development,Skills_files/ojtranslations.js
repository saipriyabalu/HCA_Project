This skill bot enables users to schedule repairs for faulty appliances, update their user profile, review and update pending service requests, and access a FAQ.\n\nIn this demo, a customer named Lynn Smith is filing a service request for a leaking water heater. The skill bot uses Lynn's phone number to retrieve her user account information and current service requests.

Click on each intent to see the respective utterances used in the training. These intents enable the skill bot to handle both expected and unexpected user input. The `unresolvedIntent` intent illustrates the latter case, the unhappy flow, by containing utterances like *what the heck?* and strings of gibberish. `Request Service Visit`, one of the intents that represent an expected, or happy flow, has utterances that approximate typical customer phrases. This intent resolves input using the `applianceType` and `applianceProblem` entities.\n\n\t!$[The Intents page with the Request Service Visit intent.$]({1})\n* In the left navbar, click !$[the left navbar Entities icon.$]({2}) to see the entities.\n\n\tThe `applianceType` and `applianceProblem` entities extract values from the user input. These are list value entities which include synonyms to optimize the detection of key terms from the user messages. The `PhoneNumber` entity is a Regular Expression entity. It\'s needed to enforce the correct input of the country-area code-number pattern that\'s required to return the customer record.\n\n* In the left navbar, click !$[the left navbar Flows icon$]({3}) to see the dialog flow definition.\n\n\tThe dialog flow is written in a variant of YAML called OBotML. This dialog flow definition includes comments that highlight the skill bot\'s capabilities. We\'ll focus on a few of them. \n\n\t-\tThe dialog flow definition uses Apache FreeMarker throughout. \n\tFor example, it uses text expressions for entity values:\n\n\t\t`"Sorry to hear that your $$${applianceType.value !\'\'$} appliance has a $$${applianceProblem.value !\'\'$} problem."`\n\n\t\tIt uses built-in date operations to calculate the appointment using the current date: \n\n\t\t`"between $$${(.now?long + 86400000)?number_to_date?string(\'MMMM dd, yyyy\')$} and $$${(.now?long + 172800000)?number_to_date?string(\'MMMM dd, yyyy\')$}"`\n\n\t- The context variable definition includes the `applianceProblem` and `applianceType` entities. These variable definitions also include one called `nlpResult`, which holds the results from the language processing. This value determines the route that user takes through the dialog flow.\n\n\t\t\tcontext:\n\t\t\t  variables:\n\t\t\t    ...\n\t\t\t    applianceProblem: "applianceProblem"\n\t\t\t    applianceType: "applianceType"\n\t\t\t    ...\n\t\t\t    iResult: "nlpresult"\n\n\t- The `intent` state definition controls the flow of the bot-user conversation, because its `iResult` variable names the intent that the platform\'s language processing framework resolves from the user input. Based on this value, the intent state routes the flow for the happy flow (triggered by resolving the `greeting`,`Request Service Visit`, `technicianAssigned`, or `getStatus` intents), the unhappy flow (`unresolvedIntent`), and Q&A (`qna`):\n\n\t\t\tintent:\n\t\t\t  component: "System.Intent"\n\t\t\t  properties:\n\t\t\t    variable: "iResult"\n\t\t\t    confidenceThreshold: 0.4\n\t\t\t    qnaEnable: true\n\t\t\t    qnaSkipIfIntentFound: true\n\t\t\t    optionsQnaLabel: "See tips on how to troubleshoot appliances?" \n\t\t\t  transitions:\n\t\t\t    actions:\n\t\t\t       Request Service Visit: "requestServiceVisit"\n\t\t\t       getStatus: "checkIfConnected"\n\t\t\t       technicianAssigned: "checkIfConnected"\n\t\t\t       updateProfile: "checkIfConnected"\n\t\t\t       greeting: "greeting"\n\t\t\t       exitFlow: "exitFlow"\n\t\t\t       qna: "qna"\n\t\t\t       unresolvedIntent: "unresolved"\n\n\t- Even if the "happy flow" flow intents get resolved, the dialog routes to the `CheckifConnected` state, which begins the skill bot\'s gatekeeping functions, a series of states that prompt for the mobile phone number and ultimately store it as a user context variable.\n\n\t\t\tstoreCurrentCustomer:\n\t\t\t  component: "System.CopyVariables"\n\t\t\t  properties:\n\t\t\t    from: "currentCustomer"\n\t\t\t    to: "user.customer"\n\t\t\t  transitions: ${$}\n\n\t\tThe user context is referenced elsewhere using FreeMarker expressions like `"Hey $$${user.customer.value.firstName$}, here is what we found in our records:" `\n\n\t-     The `CustomerRetrieval` custom component returns Lynn Smith\'s user profile by querying a database with her mobile phone number:\n\n\t\t\tfindCustomer:\n\t\t\t  component: "CustomerRetrieval"\n\t\t\t  properties:\n\t\t\t    mobilePhone: "+$$${customerPhone.value?replace(\'-\', \'\')$}"\n\t\t\t  transitions: ${$}  \n\n\t-      The next state `showCustomer` uses the `System.CommonResponse` component to output the map location along with the user details on a card. \n\n\t\t\tshowCustomer:\n\t\t\t  component: "System.CommonResponse"\n\t\t\t  properties:\n\t\t\t    processUserMessage: false\n\t\t\t    keepTurn: true\n\t\t\t    metadata: \n\t\t\t      responseItems:         \n\t\t\t      - type: "cards" \n\t\t\t        cardLayout: "vertical"\n\t\t\t        cards:\n\t\t\t        - title: "$$${customer.firstName$} $$${customer.lastName$}"\n\t\t\t          description: "$$${customer.address.formattedAddress$}\\n$$${customer.mobile$}\\n$$${customer.email$}"\n\t\t\t          imageUrl: "https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/s/mobile-cloud-service/images/bot_samples/staticmap.png"\n\t\t\t          iteratorVariable: "customer"\n\t\t\t          rangeStart: "0"\n\t\t\t          rangeSize: "1"\n\t\t\t          actions:\n\t\t\t          - label: "Show Map"\n\t\t\t            type: "url"\n\t\t\t            payload:\n\t\t\t              url: "https://www.google.com/maps?q=$$${customer.address.formattedAddress$}"\n\t\t\t            name: "Map\n\t\t\t  transitions: ${$}\n\n\t-   The dialog flow uses the `System.CommomResponse` component again to execute the carousel of appointment cards that display when you choose the **within 2 days** option.
